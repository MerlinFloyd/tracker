# Backend README

# My Fullstack App - Backend

This is the backend part of the My Fullstack App project, which is built using Go (Golang) for the API middleware and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Project Structure

- **cmd/server/main.go**: Entry point for the Go API server. Initializes the server and sets up routes and middleware.
- **internal/api/handlers.go**: Contains HTTP handlers for various API endpoints.
- **internal/database/postgres.go**: Functions for connecting to and interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **internal/models/models.go**: Defines data models used in the application, representing database entities.
- **go.mod**: Go module file that defines the module's dependencies and versioning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- PostgreSQL (version 12 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-fullstack-app.git
   cd my-fullstack-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database is set up.
2. Run the server:
   ```
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

The API server will start and listen for requests.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/example**: Example endpoint to demonstrate API functionality.
